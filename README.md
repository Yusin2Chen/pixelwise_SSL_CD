Pixel-Wise Self-Supervised Change Detection  This open-source code repository provides a Python implementation of a pixel-wise self-supervised change detection algorithm for remote sensing imagery. The algorithm leverages the power of self-supervised learning to identify changes between two co-registered images without requiring labeled data.
